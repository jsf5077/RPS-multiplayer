Hello and welcome to Roshambo! Otherwise known as Rock Paper Scissors.

This project is to demonstrate the ability to use a database for storing data that can be accessed by multiple users on the page from their own devices. Database requires a whole new level of thinking for the logic as it requires you to think about how multiple pages are handling the same information depending on the user. It also requires that one user cant break the page for another user. As demonstated in the game if you open multiple browser pages, you will find that the page behaves differently for each page as data is entered and then dynamically updated throughout the whole system. 

Databases are a very crucial part of how webpages can communicate with one another. Almost everything a user can access on the internet is attached to a database one way or another. Without this ability there is probably no internet as everything would be logged locally on your device with nowhere to go. 

It is highly recommended that you review the databse you are using along with their logic in order to understand how to access them. Before you begin typing out anything, you should consider mapping out the page with various scenarios your page could encounter so that you can plan accordingly in order to avoid bugs or site crashes. If you are new to this, you will be overwhelmed and it the only way to get confortable with this material is practice.
