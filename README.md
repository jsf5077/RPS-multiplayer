# Roshambo
Welcome to Roshambo! Otherwise known as Rock Paper Scissors. Grab some friends, have them sign in and see who is the best!

## What is this?

This is an application that demonstrates the use of a database. In this case, the database keeps track in realtime when new users have signed on/off, when players choices have been made, and the final outcome of each round. There is also a chatroom installed so that players can talk trash to one another. 

## How to Play:
- Open the app/game: https://jsf5077.github.io/Roshambo/
- Choose a name.
- If there is not an active game, you will be made a game player and will be given the choice of rock, paper, scissors.
- Once two players have made a choice, the game will update the winner/loser or tied stats and the players make their next choice.
- If you are visitor, you get front row seats to all the action as you wait for a player spot to become available.
- Whether you are a player or a visitor, you are always given the option to chat in the chatroom. Maybe even spice it up a little with     some good old fashioned trash talking.
